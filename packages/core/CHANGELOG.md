# @vyui/core

## 0.0.5

### Patch Changes

- Add AspectRatio — headless `@vyui/core` primitive (`AspectRatioRoot`, exported as both `AspectRatio` and `AspectRatioRoot`) that constrains its default slot to a given `ratio` (number, default `1`). ([#46](https://github.com/KealanAU/vyui/pull/46))

  Built for the Lynx render layer: it renders a single `<view>` using the native CSS `aspect-ratio` property (supported by Lynx's Starlight layout engine), with no absolutely-positioned padding wrapper.

- Add Avatar — headless `@vyui/core` primitives (`AvatarRoot` / `AvatarImage` / `AvatarFallback`) ported from reka-ui. `AvatarRoot` provides image load-status context; `AvatarImage` renders a Lynx `<image>` and downgrades to the error state on `binderror` (`@error`); `AvatarFallback` shows when no image is loaded, with reka's `delayMs` flash-avoidance delay. ([#46](https://github.com/KealanAU/vyui/pull/46))

  Refactor `@vyui/kit`'s `VyAvatar` to compose the new core primitives for behaviour (load-status + fallback) while keeping its public `AvatarProps` API, initials derivation, chip overlay, theming, and `AvatarGroup` size/color inheritance unchanged.

- Fixes from #67, #68 and #70. ([#71](https://github.com/KealanAU/vyui/pull/71))

  `@vyui/core`:

  - Icon: reject `color` values that could inject SVG markup when resolving icon sources (#67).
  - Sheet: multi-snap drag now settles to the nearest snap point, with main-thread usage fixes across `SheetContentImpl`, `Draggable` and `useDragGesture` (#68).
  - Primitive: treat `image` as a self-closing leaf — Vue's empty-slot fragment/comment anchors were materialized as real children by vue-lynx, and a native `<image>` with any child fails to render (native-only breakage; lynx-web tolerated it) (#70).

  `@vyui/kit`:

  - Forward icon classes/props through ActionSheet, Alert, Button, Tabs, Toast, ToggleGroup and DropdownMenu items, and fix Drawer/theme slot classes so drawer animations work again (#70).

## 0.0.4

### Patch Changes

- Add NumberField — headless `@vyui/core` primitive (`NumberFieldRoot` / `NumberFieldInput` / `NumberFieldIncrement` / `NumberFieldDecrement`) with min/max/step, clamp/snap and decimal-precision handling, plus a styled `VyNumberField` in `@vyui/kit`. ([#44](https://github.com/KealanAU/vyui/pull/44))

  Fix `Input` not reflecting programmatic value changes on native Lynx — controlled updates that don't originate from typing are now pushed through the imperative `setValue` path (the reactive `value` binding is initial-only on a native `<input>`). This makes NumberField's increment/decrement buttons update the field on iOS/Android, not just web.

  Avatar now falls back to initials/icon when its image fails to load (wires the Lynx `<image>` `binderror` event).

  Document `VyCombobox` as the autocomplete pattern — `searchable` filtering over a fixed set covers the use case, so there is no separate Autocomplete component.

  Widen `@vyui/kit`'s `@vyui/core` peer-dependency range from `^` to `~` so it tracks `0.0.x` core patches without forcing a major bump.
