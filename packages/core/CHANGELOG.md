# @vyui/core

## 0.0.4

### Patch Changes

- Add NumberField — headless `@vyui/core` primitive (`NumberFieldRoot` / `NumberFieldInput` / `NumberFieldIncrement` / `NumberFieldDecrement`) with min/max/step, clamp/snap and decimal-precision handling, plus a styled `VyNumberField` in `@vyui/kit`. ([#44](https://github.com/KealanAU/vyui/pull/44))

  Fix `Input` not reflecting programmatic value changes on native Lynx — controlled updates that don't originate from typing are now pushed through the imperative `setValue` path (the reactive `value` binding is initial-only on a native `<input>`). This makes NumberField's increment/decrement buttons update the field on iOS/Android, not just web.

  Avatar now falls back to initials/icon when its image fails to load (wires the Lynx `<image>` `binderror` event).

  Document `VyCombobox` as the autocomplete pattern — `searchable` filtering over a fixed set covers the use case, so there is no separate Autocomplete component.

  Widen `@vyui/kit`'s `@vyui/core` peer-dependency range from `^` to `~` so it tracks `0.0.x` core patches without forcing a major bump.
