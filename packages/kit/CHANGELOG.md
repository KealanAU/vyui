## 0.0.2

### Patch Changes

- Add NumberField — headless `@vyui/core` primitive (`NumberFieldRoot` / `NumberFieldInput` / `NumberFieldIncrement` / `NumberFieldDecrement`) with min/max/step, clamp/snap and decimal-precision handling, plus a styled `VyNumberField` in `@vyui/kit`. ([#44](https://github.com/KealanAU/vyui/pull/44))

  Fix `Input` not reflecting programmatic value changes on native Lynx — controlled updates that don't originate from typing are now pushed through the imperative `setValue` path (the reactive `value` binding is initial-only on a native `<input>`). This makes NumberField's increment/decrement buttons update the field on iOS/Android, not just web.

  Avatar now falls back to initials/icon when its image fails to load (wires the Lynx `<image>` `binderror` event).

  Document `VyCombobox` as the autocomplete pattern — `searchable` filtering over a fixed set covers the use case, so there is no separate Autocomplete component.

  Widen `@vyui/kit`'s `@vyui/core` peer-dependency range from `^` to `~` so it tracks `0.0.x` core patches without forcing a major bump.

  Improve `Island` defaults and DX. A new `layer` prop (`overlay` / `base` / `inline`) splits stacking from edge placement: `position` now only picks the viewport edge (`top` / `bottom`), while `layer` controls whether the island floats over content, sits on a low layer beneath modals/drawers, or drops into normal flow for a parent to place. Floating placement is applied via an inline `style` so a lone `<VyIsland>` hovers with no wrapper on Lynx (which ignores tailwind `fixed`). `Island` now defaults to `layer: 'overlay'` and `IslandGroup` defaults to `position: 'bottom'`, so both float sensibly out of the box.
